# ⚙️ Design & Interactivity Requirements

- Easy navigation between dashboards  
- Interactive charts enabling visual filtering

## 🎛️ Data Filters
Users can filter data by:
- **Product:** Category, Subcategory  
- **Location:** Region, State, City

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Sales growing faster than profit quality – Revenue +20.4%, but profit +14.2% → margin pressure from discounting or product mix.
- Loss-making categories exist – Several subcategories consistently erode profit despite strong top-line performance.
- High customer concentration & low retention – Profit driven by a few customers; most customers order only 1–2 times.
  
---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Fix or remove unprofitable categories – Reprice, renegotiate costs, bundle, or discontinue loss-making SKUs.
- Implement margin control discipline – Set weekly margin thresholds and restrict low-margin promotions.
- Strengthen retention strategy – Protect top customers and increase repeat purchase rate to grow CLV.
